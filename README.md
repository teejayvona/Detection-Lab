# Active Directory 

## Objective

The goal of the Detection Lab project was to create a regulated setting to simulate and identify cyber threats. It concentrated on processing and examining logs using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, producing simulated data to replicate actual attack scenarios. This practical engagement was crafted to enhance comprehension of network security, attack methodologies, and defensive tactics.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Splunk - Utilized as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform, Splunk facilitates the ingestion and analysis of logs for comprehensive security monitoring and incident detection.
- Wireshark - Employed as a network analysis tool, Wireshark enables the capturing and examination of network traffic for the identification of potential security threats and performance issues.
- Atomic Red Team - Leveraged for telemetry generation, Atomic Red Team provides tools to simulate realistic network traffic and attack scenarios, aiding in the validation of security controls and detection capabilities.
- Active Directory - Simulated real-world centralized directory service responsible for overseeing user account management, group memberships, and access permissions throughout the network.
